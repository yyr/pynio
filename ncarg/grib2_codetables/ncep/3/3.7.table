# Code Table 3.7: Spectral data representation mode
0:0:Reserved
1:1:The complex numbers Fn^m (Code Table 3.6) are stored for m>=0 as pairs of real numbers Re(Fn^m), Im(Fn^m) ordered with n increasing from m to N(m), first for m=0 and then for m=1, 2, ... M.

# Note:

#(1) Values of N(m) for common truncations cases:
# Triangular M = J = K, N(m) = J
# Rhomboidal K = J + M, N(m) = J+m
# Trapezoidal K = J, K > M, N(m) = J
